# For the Community
For Project #5, we were tasked with using older HTML/CSS concepts such as DOM elements: input, forms, and buttons, and newer Javascript concepts like localStorage, to create an interactive quiz or tool. 

## About
For my final project, my quiz will help young adults find their suitable career path. I personally took a lot of future career related quizzes, and my brother is going through the same thing right now. At the end of the quiz it will display all the answers in properly formed sentences. For example “You are an extrovert. (there will be a button) Jobs we recommend: blah blah blah.” 
### Process & Documentation
10 Questions:
What is the highest level of education you have so far?
What or who motivates you?
What are the three adjectives your friends would use to describe you?
Are you a team leader or follower?
What jobs do you dislike?
What are your interests? E.g. Art, Maths, Science, etc.
Do you know who you already want to be?
What is your expected salary?
What are your skills?

Link map: It will start with asking your name (because I believe it makes it more personal and as if the website truly curated the answers just for you, and is not an automated message.
There will be a next button to press after answering a question and it will take you to another page with the next question. It will repeat until you reach the end and it will display your results. There will be an about button, job types, and homepage button. There will also be a rating at the end to make it look more personalized and professional.

### Challenges & Struggles
I spent a lot of time on this project, and I believe it is my best so far, especially when comparing it to projects 3 and 4. I am very happy with how this turned out.
      
I struggled with how to implement so much information (all the different types of careers in the world) into the project. I learned a lot about span ID and how to output radio buttons in the results page. I also used rita that we learned in the last project to randomize career recommendations, I used artistConk and manually wrote a bunch of different job names. If I had more time to work on this project, I would connect it to an API and make the recommended careers be more personalized and accurate using "if" statements so that it is more real. For example, so that when you answer "I hate the jobs of engineers and pilots" those jobs do not appear in the final recommendation, and when you say your skills are "art" it will recommend you more creative jobs. I would also make it possible for me to receive people's reviews, because for now it is there just for aesthetic purposes and is not fully functional.
