# For the Community
For Project #5, we were tasked with using older HTML/CSS concepts such as DOM elements: input, forms, and buttons, and newer Javascript concepts like localStorage, to create an interactive quiz or tool. 
## About
For my final project, my quiz will help young adults find their suitable career path. I personally took a lot of future career related quizzes, and my brother is going through the same thing right now. At the end of the quiz it will display all the answers in properly formed sentences. For example “You are a team leader. Suitable jobs include: blah blah blah.”

### Challenges & Struggles
I struggled with how to implement so much information (all the different types of careers in the world) into the project. I learned a lot about span ID and how to output radio buttons in the results page. If I had more time to work on this project, I would connect it to an API and make the recommended careers be more personalized and accurate using "if" statements so that it is more real.
